Most users don't want to just scroll all the way back up especially if they are reading a long post. This plugin becomes handy to add the floating scroll top icon for the easy and fast navigation. 

It also adds the Next Previous floating pagination links so the users can go to the next post once finished. Packed with the smart conditions to display scroll top and next previous post links on scroll along with condition for each icon to display on specific page/post.

What? Want to make it look like your site? No worries, it comes with the real time customiser support using WP customizer (yes, no more guessing) to match the Scroll Top and other icons.

<h3>USERS REVIEWS</h3>
"**Hands down best Navi that works for me.** - Clean, Functional and Genius. Makes navigating any post, blog, etc. etc. a lot easier, especially for mobile use." - [darklight99](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hands-down-best-navi-that-works-for-me/')

"**Great Stuff** - If you write continuous posts under the same category, this app is a godsend. It allows you to switch between posts of the same category.

Very great plugin for writing novels chapter by chapter" - [eugenelim88](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-stuff-223/')

"**A simple and elegant solution** - A simple and elegant way for viewers to “flip” through your site’s posts chronically, as if they are successive pages in a magazine. The Floating Links plug-in solved a huge problem for me — I have lots of old content (nearly 1,000 posts spanning several years) — some of which is still relevant — that people couldn’t easily browse. Now they can. Thank you!" - [mfmfuller](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-simple-and-elegant-solution/')
